This beer commemorates our 9th year in 2016. This beer originally appeared as AB:04 in 2010, perhaps the most sought after beer we ever brewed. Dog E is a 16.1% Imperial Stout brewed with copious amounts of dark malts, pure cacao and coffee, balanced by the subtle addition of naga chili, and barrel-aged. Perfect for ageing in your cellar, or drinking fresh if you’re lucky enough to get your paws on a bottle.","image_url":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/222.png","abv":16.1,"ibu":100,"target_fg":1125,"target_og":1015,"ebc":500,"srm":254,"ph":4.4,"attenuation_level":84,"volume":{"value":20,"unit":"liters"},"boil_volume":{"value":25,"unit":"liters"},"method":{"mash_temp":[{"temp":{"value":63,"unit":"celsius"},"duration":90}],"fermentation":{"temp":{"value":21,"unit":"celsius"}},"twist":"5g Habanero and 3g lemon drop chili in FV"},"ingredients":{"malt":[{"name":"Pale Ale","amount":{"value":7.5,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Wheat","amount":{"value":0.5,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Flaked Oats","amount":{"value":0.75,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Dark Crystal","amount":{"value":0.75,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Carafa Special Malt Type 1","amount":{"value":0.5,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Carafa Special Malt Type 3","amount":{"value":0.5,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Rye","amount":{"value":0.75,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Brown","amount":{"value":0.75,"unit":"kilograms"}}],"hops":[{"name":"Chinook","amount":{"value":25,"unit":"grams"},"add":"start","attribute":"bitter"},{"name":"Sorachi Ace","amount":{"value":50,"unit":"grams"},"add":"start","attribute":"bitter"},{"name":"Ginger Powder","amount":{"value":1.25,"unit":"grams"},"add":"end","attribute":"flavour"},{"name":"Honey","amount":{"value":1250,"unit":"grams"},"add":"end","attribute":"flavour"},{"name":"Cold Infused Coffee","amount":{"value":25,"unit":"grams"},"add":"end","attribute":"flavour"}],"yeast":"Wyeast 1272 - American Ale II™"},"food_pairing":["Char sui pork buns","Spicy beef empanadas","Chocolate cheesecake"],"brewers_tips":"With stronger styles (like imperial stouts), feel free to cellar your beer and try a bottle every few months to see how the flavours have developed – often the beer picks up new, incredible flavours.","contributed_by":"Sam Mason <samjbmason>"},{"id":122,"name":"Dog Fight (w/ Flying Dog)","tagline":"Rye IPA - Flying Dog Collab.","first_brewed":"10/2012","description":"A clash of kings.
