# Punk API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samjbmason/punkapi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/samjbmason/punkapi)
> Crowd Sourcing an API from BrewDog's hugely generous [DIY Dog](https://www.brewdog.com/diydog)

**Status: 17 of 215 completed**

In the spirit of DIY & giving back I thought I would attempt to collect all the BrewDog Recipes from their DIY Dog pdf and create an api from it!

## What's the deal?
If you head to the [`data`](data/) folder you will see all the recipes so far, I'm asking all you beer lovers to take 5 minutes to choose one of the recipes and convert it into a JSON file using the [`TEMPLATE.json`](TEMPLATE.json) file and submit it as a PR.

## Where can I find the recipes?
Head over to BrewDog's DIY Dog [page to download the free PDF](https://www.brewdog.com/diydog)

## The TEMPLATE.json is missing something?
If people have any suggestions on information that is missing from the template please drop an issue or a PR.

## What do you plan to do with all this data?
Once this is all done I will create a fully searchable API from the data and of course it will be open source and free to use for all your beer hackers out there.

Below is a list of all the beers and the ones that have already been done:
